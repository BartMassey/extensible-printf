# Extensible-Printf
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This is a Haskell `Text.Printf` implementation enhanced to
allow extending `printf` to new datatypes. It was inspired
by my need for such a thing, and by finding this two-message
email-list
[thread](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/4726)
from May 2006 in which John Meacham and Simon Marlow suggest
an implementation.

This work is reasonably well-documented in Haddock, and is
under a 3-clause BSD license as per Lennart Augustsson's
original implementation of `Text.Printf`, from which most
of the code was taken, and much was heavily modified.
