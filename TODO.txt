* Fix bugs found in testing:
  * Don't stick an extra 0 in front of the zero-fill in
    e.g. printf "%0#5o" 1
* Put in remaining checks for invalid formats
* Fix RealFloat formatting (deferred for now)
  * Fix standard floating formats
  * Implement "#" alt floating formats in alt float code
* Deal with locale-specific "," and "." (deferred for now)
