* Fix bugs found in testing:
  * Don't stick a 0 in front of the zero-fill in
    e.g. printf "%0#5o" 1
  * Treat Char arguments as Int so that the modifiers
    are collected.
  * Treat 0 for "%x" and "%x" as with "%o": don't add prefix.
  * When a precision is given, ignore zero-fill.
* Deal with locale-specific "," and "." (deferred for now)
* Fix RealFloat formatting (deferred for now)
  * Fix standard floating formats
  * Implement "#" alt floating formats in alt float code
